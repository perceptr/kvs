# Key-Value storage

Key-value online storage is a type of storage system that allows users to store data in the form of key-value pairs. In this system, each piece of data is associated with a unique key, which can be used to retrieve the corresponding value. This type of storage is often used in applications where data needs to be quickly accessed and retrieved, such as in databases and caching systems. Key-value online storage is highly scalable and can support a large number of users and data sets. It is also easy to use, as users can simply provide the key to retrieve the associated value, without having to know the underlying structure of the data.
